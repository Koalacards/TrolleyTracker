# TrolleyTracker
Welcome to TrolleyTracker, which will (maybe) eventually be a
bot that will play minigames on the TTR discord.

To run the bot, run the bot.py file in any python environment and as long
as the python terminal is open, the bot will run.

If you cannot run a play command, you have to add to the COMMAND_READ_IDS
in globalvars.py to the channel ID that you want your commands to run in.

The command line pickup for the bot is currently koalabot, but it may be
changed as the bot goes closer to development.
