# TrolleyTracker
Welcome to TrolleyTracker, which will (maybe) eventually be a
bot that will play minigames on the TTR discord.

To run the bot:
1. Download this code or glone it from git.

2. create a file called confidential.py, and in that file put in:
    RUN_ID = [The token of your bot] (NOTE: This token should not be shared with anyone or put in any repository.)

3. in globalvars.py, add your wanted channel ID for commands in the COMMAND_CHANNEL_ID's list

4. run bot.py
